# Hi there! 👋

My name is Lucia Micheloud and I'm currently a 19-year-old Full Stack Developer student at Henry. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building innovative projects. I have experience working with JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, CSS, HTML, among other tools and frameworks.

Apart from my technical skills, I have also improved my soft skills, such as assertive communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, and frustration tolerance. These skills have helped me to become a better developer and work more efficiently in a team.

On this GitHub profile, you will find some of the projects I have worked on during my studies at Henry. I hope they give you an idea of my coding style, creativity, and passion for coding.
